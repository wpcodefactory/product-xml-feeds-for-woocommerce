2. Marketplace-specific Customization: Fine-tune your feeds to align with the unique specifications of each marketplace, whether it's Google, Social sites, Amazon, or any other marketplace.

3. Dynamic Product Selection: Include or exclude products based on categories, tags, and product.

4. Scheduled Updates (Pro): Set your XML feeds to refresh automatically, keeping your listings as current as your inventory.

5. Advanced Filtering Options (Partially Pro): Full customization with advanced filtering, allowing you to curate feeds that resonate with specific marketplace audiences.
